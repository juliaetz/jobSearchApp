CS 3541 Spring Group Project Final. This project was developed with the help of Benjamin Ponto, Andrew Martini, Angela Danger, and Cody Olson.


Searching for jobs can be stressful, which is why our app "Unemployed?" is designed to make the process easier. From the career database, users can search and filter by name, locatation, work setting, and salary. Within the app, users may also "favorite" listings they are interested in, schedule interviews in a calender, view interview resources, and set short- and long-term career goals. Personal contributions include the favoriting feature and Job Information page.
